# Moire / Line Drawings
Web application for the final art piece of course Art, Mathematics and Technology. 

Hosted here: https://linedrawings.suzannawentzel.nl/, take a look if this seems interesting :).


## Description
This is an art application that generates line drawings between two hypotrochoids (mathematical functions). Occasionally this creates Moire patterns, which are very intriguing. More information on how the math behind it works can also be found on the website mentioned before.
